      'I‚Äôve worked with other trainers in the past but can honestly say I‚Äôve never seen the same results as I have by working with Jay. Admittedly we found our student/teacher chemistry and Within the first few months of training with him I started to see definite changes to my endurance levels and techniques. Jay has an impeccable Talent of being encouraging and kind while providing you with the best, most challenging sessions.  I‚Äôve never left a training session with him disappointed! In the current years Jay has seen me through two consecutive, healthy pregnancies.  He found ways to keep our training sessions fun and effective even during my most tired, unmotivated days of my last trimester.  My doctor cleared me to work out again after my second baby and Jay was the first person I called!  Jay is now seeing me through the next phase of my fitness journey pushing me towards new goals and my ultimate mom bod!',

      "What makes JayMark different from other trainers is his ability to bring out the best in everybody - regardless shape, size, age or experience. His positive energy is infectious and his knowledge about training and diet seems to be endless. You don't have to be an athlete to commit to his training, but you will definitely feel like one after you're done! ",

      'When I first started training with Jmark, I weighed about 160 lbs. In less than a year after we started training, I dropped 30 lbs and being a baker it had literally nothing to do with my diet. He also helped me realize being fit was not just about losing weight but about working on getting stronger too. His energy is so infectious, he makes every class, hardcore as they might be, a whole lot of fun! By fun I mean he‚Äôll kill u, but you‚Äôll thank him later! I‚Äôm a 38 year old mom and this is the fittest I‚Äôve been all my life!',

      "I have had a number of personal trainers I've worked with and I can say that Jay's style has been very effective so far. He manages to be motivational while still maintaining an accurate awareness of my limitations.¬†I can tell he is not unrealistic with where he pushes clients.¬†Overall, my experience has been positive and plan to continue working with Jay -- I would recommend him to friends of all levels of fitness experience; athlete or beginner.",

      "Jay is by far the best trainer that I've come across. I have been training with him for a couple of years and his workouts never cease to amaze me. They are ever changing, very creative and most importantly, challenging. I've watched my body change drastically and become the strongest that it's been due to his expertise. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable but he is very encouraging through out his sessions as well. I would have to say that the sessions that stick out in my mind the most, are the ones that I enter with little to no energy and he pushes me through to the point that I leave feeling much stronger, energized and better about myself.",

      "Jay Mark has taught me so much over the 2 years of knowing him, I'm forever grateful. So grateful to the point that anytime I receive a compliment on my striking skills, I hand it to him. Jay has been so influential to me, I‚Äôve learned so much about Muay Thai & striking in general due to his teachings. It means so much more to me that he taught my first lesson in kickboxing. He took me from not knowing the tiny basics to having the muscle memory and speed that I currently do. It's all owed to him, his patience and drive is so inspirational, a champ, displaying what a REAL COACH embodies. He‚Äôs not only my mentor and coach, he‚Äôs a friend and the big bro I have never had, and always wished for. Reign on king.",

      'From my very first session with Jay Mark, I realized what I was missing all those years ‚Äúboxing‚Äù. Each session with Jay Mark is not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. As a professional fighter, Jay Mark is skilled in Muai Thai fighting and technique. In additions, he has years of experience in general fitness and personal training, a rare combination to find in a trainer.  Over the years there hasn‚Äôt been a question he hasn‚Äôt able to answer intelligently (and I ask a lot of questions üôà) or a move he wasn‚Äôt able to explain and help me master. On a weekly basis he challenges my fitness level, learning and growing each week.',

      'Jay has trained me in muay thai and kickboxing for 2 years; and in that time has given me the confidence and ability to compete and win in amateur competitions.  Jay knows how to bring out the best in you, while always keeping a smile.  One of the things I appreciate most about Jay is how he embodies everything he teaches: confidence, humility, and work ethic.  Thanks Jay!',
